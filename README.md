# IPL_Franchise_Team_Analysis-Python_Project
This project builds a data-driven IPL Franchise Team based on player performance from 2021 to 2024.
Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the analysis focuses on selecting an optimal, role-balanced XI using unique scoring techniques and statistical insights.

# 🎯 Project Summary
Over four IPL seasons (2021–2024), hundreds of players batted, bowled, and contributed differently. Instead of simply picking top run-scorers or wicket-takers, this project analyzes:

- Multi-season performance
- Player consistency
- Role-specific strengths
- Statistical normalization
- Balanced team-building logic
- Visual pattern recognition
