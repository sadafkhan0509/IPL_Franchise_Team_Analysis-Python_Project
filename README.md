# IPL_Franchise_Team_Analysis-Python_Project
This project builds a data-driven IPL Franchise Team based on player performance from 2021 to 2024.
Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the analysis focuses on selecting an optimal, role-balanced XI using unique scoring techniques and statistical insights.

# 🎯 Project Summary
Over four IPL seasons (2021–2024), hundreds of players batted, bowled, and contributed differently. Instead of simply picking top run-scorers or wicket-takers, this project analyzes:

- Multi-season performance
- Player consistency
- Role-specific strengths
- Statistical normalization
- Balanced team-building logic
- Visual pattern recognition

The final result is a high-impact Franchise XI backed by data — reliable, balanced, and optimized for real match conditions.

# 📁 About This Notebook
This project is entirely contained in one Jupyter Notebook, which includes:

- Data cleaning
- Player performance analysis
- Visualizations
- Scoring system
- Team optimization logic
- Final selected IPL XI

There is no external script — all logic, visuals, and outputs are in a single notebook for easy review.

## 📊 Dataset Used

**Source:** Kaggle IPL Dataset  

**Files analyzed:**
- `matches.csv`
- `deliveries.csv`

**Filters applied:**
- Seasons from **2021 to 2024**
- Minimum **3 matches** for player inclusion


# 🧹 Step 1 — Data Cleaning & Preparation
The notebook performs:

✔ Data loading
✔ Type conversion (overs, runs, wickets, dismissals)
✔ Season extraction
✔ Match-to-delivery merging
✔ Removal of incomplete records
✔ Filtering years 2021–2024

This ensures only high-quality and relevant data is used.

# 🏏 Step 2 — Batting Performance Analysis
For every season (2021–2024), the following were computed:
- Total runs
- Balls faced
- Strike rate
- Matches played
- Season-wise ranking
# 🔍 Insight:
This reveals which batsmen are consistent performers, not one-season wonders.

# 📈 Visualization:
Top Batsmen Runs Trend (2021–2024)
A line chart tracking runs across seasons for each top batsman — helps identify form trends and patterns.

# 🎯 Step 3 — Bowling Performance Analysis
Key bowling metrics calculated:
- Wickets taken
- Balls bowled
- Overs
- Economy rate
- Bowling strike rate
- Match consistency
# 🔍 Insight:
Allows comparison of control (economy) vs impact (wickets).

# 📊 Visualization:
Bowler Efficiency — Wickets vs Economy
Clear scatter plot with non-overlapping legend to show separation between strike bowlers and economical bowlers.

# 🔁 Step 4 — All-Rounder Analysis
All-rounders were evaluated using both batting and bowling contributions:
- Runs
- Strike rate
- Wickets
- Economy
- Match impact score
# 🔍 Insight:
Shows which players offer true dual-department value — essential for team balance.

# 🔢 Step 5 — Normalization & Scoring (Unique Approach)
Instead of raw stats, a balanced and fair scoring system was used.

✔ Normalized Features:
- Runs (0–1)
- Strike Rate (0–1)
- Wickets (0–1)
- Inverse Economy (1/economy → better for lower economy)

✔ Role-Specific Scoring:
Batsman Score = 60% Runs + 40% Strike Rate
Bowler Score = 70% Wickets + 30% Economy Impact
All-Rounder Score = Balanced combo from both

This ensures players are judged based on their role, not unfair comparisons.

# ⭐ Step 6 — Consistency Score (Your Unique Idea)
A special score was added to reward players who performed across multiple seasons.
Consistency = Number of seasons played (2021–2024)
# 🔍 Insight:
Consistent performers are more valuable in a franchise system than one-season spikes.

# 🧮 Step 7 — Final Score (Weighted Approach)
To combine all factors:
Final Score = 0.85 × Performance Score  + 0.15 × Consistency Score

This maintains:
- Strong weight on actual performance
- Bonus for multi-season reliability

# 🛠 Step 8 — Team Building Logic (Balanced XI)
The final Franchise XI follows a real cricket team structure:
- 4 Batsmen
- 2 All-Rounders
- 4 Bowlers
- 1 Additional Best Player (based on final score)
This ensures:

✔ Depth in batting
✔ Strong bowling attack
✔ Versatility through all-rounders
✔ No overloading of any role

This approach is unique, logical, and easy to justify.

# 🏆 Final Output — Best IPL Franchise XI (2021–2024)
The notebook outputs:
- Player name
- Role
- Final score
- Main stats (Runs, Wickets, SR, Economy)
- Season participation details
Plus a bar chart visualization of final player scores.

# 📊 Final Visualizations Included in Notebook
These charts make the analysis clear and visually strong:
1. Top Batsmen Trend (Line Plot)
2. Bowler Efficiency Chart (Scatter Plot)
3. All-Rounders Performance (Scatter Plot)
4. Final Team Score Plot (Bar Chart)
5. Team Role Distribution (Pie Chart)
Each chart includes clean styling and legends placed outside the graph.

# 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

# 📝 Interpretation & Key Insights
- Data across multiple seasons gives much better reliability than single-year stats.
- Normalization allows fair comparison across roles.
- Consistency helps identify real franchise value players.
- Balanced team structure is crucial for making a practical XI.
- Visuals reveal performance patterns not visible in raw tables.
- Unique scoring formula makes the final team selection unbiased and replicable.
